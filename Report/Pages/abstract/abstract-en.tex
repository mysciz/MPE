\chapter{Abstract}
Focusing on the field of computer vision, we analyze the application of partial differential equations in computer science from the perspective of image processing. Introducing from the traditional partial differential equation denoising model to establish the basic understanding of image denoising sound. By comparing and analyzing the ROF full variational model and the LLT model, we understand the characteristics and advantages and disadvantages of different models, and make an original use of programming technology to show the differences of the models intuitively. Finally, we look forward to the development of PDE equations in the field of image processing.
